Rather than just send them the sticker, the person from the UK created a GitHub repo to store the sticker and included terms of use for the design.
The idea is that users can submit designs, and download designs, so that queer stickers can be spread all over the world!</description></item><item><title>Terms</title><link>https://ozlocke.github.io/the-queer-sticker-depot/terms/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 21:05:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ozlocke.github.io/the-queer-sticker-depot/terms/</guid><description>Licence The stickers available here are shared under the following licencing:
