+++

The Queer Sticker Depot was created when someone from Australia wanted to print a sticker designed by someone in the UK. Rather than just send them the sticker, the person from the UK created a GitHub repo to store the sticker and included terms of use for the design.

The idea is that users can submit designs, and download designs, so that queer stickers can be spread all over the world!

This website is actually just a gallery to provide users with a nice way to browse the available stickers. Clicking on a picture will take the user to the GitHub folder containing all the image assets relating to that sticker. That way users can get the ideal image type, and even made modifications to the design (see [Terms](../terms/))
