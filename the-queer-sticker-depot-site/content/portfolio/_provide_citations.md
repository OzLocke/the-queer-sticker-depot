The words 'Provide Citations or STFU' in black around a hand with middle and index fingers raised in the 'peace' sign, coloured in red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, and surrounded by hearts, on a circle of white. Beneath are the words 'You made the claim, you back it up' in white. The image background is waves in horizontal stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
